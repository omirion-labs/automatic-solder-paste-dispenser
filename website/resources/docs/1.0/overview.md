## What is ASPD100?

It is a tool that allows to apply precisely and in controlled quantity any products such as: solder paste, flux, glue, ...

## History

The history of this tool was born from this problem, each time I create a new PCB with CMS components I have two methods to apply the solder paste. 

---

#### Method 1 : Stencil to apply the solder paste.

* Avantage:
	* Uniformity. Apply an even amount of solder paste across every SMD pad on your PCB.
	* Efficiency. Apply solder paste to the entire board all at once instead of one pad at a time.
	* Reliability. Reliably assembled board since each pad receives the same amount of solder paste.

* Disadvantage:
	* The stencil is customized to the PCB designer. It is not economical (raw materials) when only 1 or 2 prototype is build.

#### Method 2 : Syringe to apply the solder paste.

* Avantage:
	* No raw materials is needed to create a stencil to apply the solder paste on custom PCB. 
		* 1 syringe = x specific PCB layout.
		* 1 stencil = 1 specific PCB layout.

* Disadvantage:
	* Uniformity more difficult.
	* Apply solder paste one pad at a time.
	* Each pad not receives the same amount of solder paste.

#### Conclusion
The conclusion is I want a tool between these two methods for these reasons:
* Reduce the hardship of the second method
* Reduce the use of raw material used to create a stencil for each new PCB layout.
